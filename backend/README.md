## Current Setup

The project is now configured with Clerk authentication. The Clerk provider is set up in `main.tsx` with your provided publishable key.

## Next Steps

1. Migrate existing authentication components to use Clerk
2. Set up Supabase integration for database functionality
3. Create API endpoints for data management
4. Implement user roles and permissions

## Integration Notes

- Clerk handles authentication, user management, and sessions
- Supabase can be used for database operations and additional backend functionality
- The frontend components need to be updated to use Clerk's authentication state
